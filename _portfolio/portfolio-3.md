This project focused on creating a dynamic and engaging two-player game demo inspired by the classic Battle City game. Using C++ and OpenGL, we developed a game where players control two tanks to battle against each other in a simulated environment. The project emphasized realistic physical motion and interactions, including tank movement, bullet trajectories, and collision dynamics, to deliver an immersive gameplay experience.

The goal of the project was to design a functional game demo with robust physics simulation, real-time rendering, and smooth controls, providing players with an intuitive and entertaining experience. I contributed to the project by implementing the physical simulation aspect of the game. This included:
- Bullet Dynamics: Calculating trajectories, speeds, and impacts of bullets fired by the tanks.
- Collision Detection and Response: Implementing algorithms to detect and handle collisions between tanks, bullets, and environmental obstacles such as walls or barriers.

The final Battle City demo successfully implemented a two-player mode where tanks could move, fire bullets, and interact with their environment in real time. Key outcomes include:
- Smooth Gameplay: Players experienced fluid and responsive control of their tanks.
- Accurate Collision Responses: Collisions between tanks, bullets, and obstacles behaved as expected, adding strategic depth to the game.
- Engaging Visuals: OpenGL rendered the tank motions, bullet trajectories, and collisions seamlessly, enhancing the gameplay experience.

The project demonstrated the effective use of C++ and OpenGL in creating a physics-driven game. The battle simulation provided players with an engaging and realistic gaming experience, laying the groundwork for further enhancements such as AI-controlled opponents or additional gameplay mechanics.
